//! This example test the flash connected to the RP2040 chip.

//! This was taken directly from https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/blob/0cbdd8b9c84511eb2a9b7065fecb0f56a9a255d2/examples/rp/src/bin/flash.rs.
//! I just modified it a little to fit *my* purpose better.
//! The read and write functionality was removed, don't need it.
//! I just need it to clear the flash area I'm using in the main app.
